Salary Calculator for Egyptians in GCC (PPP-Based)

This project is a salary equivalence calculator designed to help Egyptian tech professionals compare their income in Egypt with expected salaries in the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than misleading exchange rates.

✨ Features

User Input: Enter your current salary in EGP.

Country Selection: Compare between Egypt, UAE, Qatar, and KSA.

Target Multiplier: Choose 1×, 2×, 3×… lifestyle improvements.

Work Mode: Compare working abroad vs. remote from Egypt.

Automatic PPP Conversion: Uses IMF PPP factors.

Interactive Chart: PPP trends (2000–2030) visualized with Chart.js.

Auto Calculation: Runs with default settings (EGP 20,000 in 2025).

🔧 How It Works

Your salary in Egypt (e.g. EGP 20,000) is converted into PPP dollars:

20,000 ÷ 7.13 ≈ 2,805 $ PPP


This PPP salary is adjusted by the target country’s PPP factor. Example for UAE (2.23):

2,805 × 2.23 ≈ 6,255 AED


If you select “double lifestyle” (×2), the number doubles:

6,255 × 2 ≈ 12,510 AED/month


The calculator displays:

Salary equivalents in Egypt, UAE, Qatar, KSA.

Highlighted target salary based on your selection.

📊 Example Scenarios

20,000 EGP in Egypt ≈ 80,000 AED/year in UAE (same lifestyle).

To double your lifestyle in UAE → request around 12,000 AED/month.

Remote work from Egypt for UAE → ~3,000 AED/month (≈ 40,000 EGP at FX).
